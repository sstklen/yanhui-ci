# Confucius Debug — 孔子除錯

> *"不貳過" — Never repeat a mistake.* (Confucius, Analects 6.3)

AI-powered debugging assistant backed by the **YanHui Knowledge Base** — a growing collection of 6,800+ scraped issues and 980+ imported solutions from real AI agent projects (OpenClaw, Claude Code, MCP, Anthropic SDK, Codex, Aider, and more).

## How It Works

```
You hit a bug
    ↓
1. Search YanHui KB (FREE, instant)
    ↓
   Found? → Use the fix directly
   Not found? ↓
2. Confucius AI analyzes (FREE)
    ↓
   Fix saved to KB → Next person gets it FREE
```

## Tools

### `confucius_search` — Search the Knowledge Base (FREE)

Always try this first. Searches 980+ verified solutions for matching patterns.

```bash
# Search for a bug pattern
curl -s -X POST https://api.washinmura.jp/api/v2/debug-ai/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "OpenClaw Telegram plugin not connecting", "limit": 5}'
```

**When to use:** Any time you encounter an error. It's free and instant.

### `confucius_analyze` — AI-Powered Analysis (FREE)

Only if search returns 0 results. Confucius AI analyzes your error, finds root cause, and provides a fix.

```bash
# Analyze a new bug
curl -s -X POST https://api.washinmura.jp/api/v2/debug-ai \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "error_description": "OpenClaw Telegram bot not responding after restart",
    "error_message": "Error: ETELEGRAM: 409 Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request",
    "lobster_id": "'"$CONFUCIUS_LOBSTER_ID"'"
  }'
```

**What you get back:**
- `root_cause` — Why this happened
- `fix_description` — How to fix it
- `fix_patch` — Actual code to apply
- `confidence` — How sure Confucius is

### `confucius_contribute` — Share Your Fix (FREE)

Solved a bug? Share it so nobody hits it again.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.washinmura.jp/api/v2/debug-ai/onboard \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lobster_id": "'"$CONFUCIUS_LOBSTER_ID"'",
    "entries": [{
      "error_description": "What was the bug",
      "fix_description": "How you fixed it",
      "error_category": "config_error"
    }]
  }'
```

## MCP Integration (Recommended)

For Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "confucius-debug": {
      "url": "https://api.washinmura.jp/mcp/debug"
    }
  }
}
```

This gives you 4 tools automatically: `debug_search`, `debug_analyze`, `debug_contribute`, `debug_hello`.

## What's in the Knowledge Base?

| Platform | Bugs Solved | A-Rate |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| MCP (Model Context Protocol) | 261 | 87% |
| Anthropic / Claude | 392 | 80% |
| Telegram | 101 | 97% |
| Memory / RAG | 94 | 87% |
| Browser | 73 | 92% |
| OpenAI / GPT | 54 | 87% |
| Docker | 51 | 84% |
| Discord | 40 | 93% |
| Cron / Scheduler | 37 | 92% |
| WhatsApp | 16 | 94% |
| Google / Gemini | 15 | 100% |
| Ollama / Local LLM | 14 | 93% |

**A-Rate** = percentage of fixes rated S (perfect) or A (good) by independent AI verification.

## Track Record

- 280 replies posted on GitHub issues
- 9 confirmed correct by project maintainers (including OpenClaw creator)
- 0 corrections (zero mistakes confirmed by community)
- Knowledge base growing daily via automated pipeline

## Setup

1. Set your identity (required for `analyze` and `contribute`, optional for `search`):
   ```bash
   export CONFUCIUS_LOBSTER_ID="your-username"
   ```

2. Test the connection (no ID needed for search):
   ```bash
   curl -s https://api.washinmura.jp/api/v2/debug-ai/search \
     -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "test", "limit": 1}'
   ```

3. Start debugging! When you hit any error, search first, analyze if needed.

## Workflow for OpenClaw Users

When OpenClaw throws an error:

1. **Copy the error message**
2. **Search YanHui KB** — `confucius_search("your error message")`
3. **Found a match?** — Apply the fix directly
4. **No match?** — `confucius_analyze("description", "error message")`
5. **Fixed it yourself?** — `confucius_contribute(...)` to help others

## External Endpoints

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Confucius Debug API | https://api.washinmura.jp/api/v2/debug-ai | Search, Analyze, Contribute |
| Confucius MCP | https://api.washinmura.jp/mcp/debug | MCP protocol endpoint |

## Security & Privacy

- **What leaves your machine:** Only the error description and error message you provide. No source code, no file contents, no environment variables are sent.
- **What's stored:** Error descriptions and fixes are stored in the YanHui KB to help future users. No personally identifiable information is stored beyond your chosen lobster_id.
- **Authentication:** Everything is free. Your lobster_id is used for identification only, not billing.
- **Data retention:** Contributions are permanent (that's the point — never repeat a mistake).
